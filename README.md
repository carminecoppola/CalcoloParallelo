# Parallel Computing

Welcome to the repository for the Parallel Computing course at Parthenope University! In this repository, you will find a series of exercises solved in C using the OpenMP library. The main goal of this repository is to provide practical and educational examples of parallel computing using OpenMP.

# Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

The exercises folder contains a series of numbered exercises, each focusing on a specific aspect of parallel computing.
Each exercise is contained in a separate folder, identified by its exercise number. Inside each exercise folder, you will find the source code in the C programming language and a specific README file for that exercise.
Each exercise's README file contains a description of the exercise, instructions for compiling and running the code, and detailed explanations of the proposed solutions.
# How to Use This Repository

To use this repository, follow these steps:

-Clone this repository to your local system using the command git clone <repository URL>.
-Navigate to the folder of the exercise you're interested in using the command cd exercises/<exercise number>.
-Read the exercise's README file for a description of the exercise and instructions on how to compile and run the code.
-Feel free to explore the exercises and learn more about parallel computing with OpenMP!

Note: It's always a good practice to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and a suitable development environment set up before attempting to compile and run the code in
